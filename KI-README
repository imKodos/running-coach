Goals before starting:

I want to build something allows me to open up some audio files from my google drive

-should access google drive from an api
-audio files are long so maybe download or store them only when we want to listen to a specific one
-have a nice navigation scroll and navigation arrow feature
-maybe add in some kind of animation on the navigation

-be able to listen to the audio with the app minimized
-when playing audio file, have play, stop, pause, and time UI

flatView animation:
-also uses MotiView instead of view

used MotiView and react-native-reanimated
(npm i @motify/components)
(npm i react-native-reanimated)
